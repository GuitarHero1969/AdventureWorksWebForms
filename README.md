Replacing the ASP.NET postback functionality with AJAX in a WebForms project

This is a 'Work in Progress' and also a revision exercise to re-familiarise myself with ASP.NET webforms technology
using AJAX to replace the postback system employed by ASP.NET webforms

Of course there will be a limit to what I can do, since I am attempting to replacing old tools (which work fine, but I find nasty, clunky and hard to learn, like webform controls and scriptmangagers) with nice new stuff like Axios for example.

Data is retrieved and sent from javascript to web methods written in C# in an aspx page, which in turn uses LINQ to connect to the Adventure Works 2014 database.

The additional aim is revision and familiarity with JavaScript and JQuery and it's application to building a CMS front end for managing sales orders and understanding how to created business logic with JavaScript
